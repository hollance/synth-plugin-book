# Code Your Own Synth Plug-Ins With C++ and JUCE

This is the source code that accompanies the book [Code Your Own Synth Plug-Ins With C++ and JUCE](https://leanpub.com/synth-plugin) by Matthijs Hollemans.

![The book cover](book-cover.jpg)

This 360-page book teaches step-by-step how to design and build a software synthesizer plug-in that can be used in all the popular DAWs such as Logic Pro, Ableton Live, REAPER, FL Studio, Cubase, Bitwig Studio, and others. The plug-in is made using industry standard tools for audio programming: the JUCE framework and the C++ programming language. You'll learn all the fundamentals of writing audio plug-ins in general and synths in particular, in an easy-to-follow guide that is light on math and heavy on being practical.

The book is available for purchase from [The Audio Programmer](https://theaudioprogrammer.com/learn/synth-plugin-book) as PDF and EPUB, and from [Amazon](https://amzn.to/46q1usI) as paperback.

> **NOTE:** This repo accompanies the version of the book that was originally published on Leanpub.com. Visit [github.com/TheAudioProgrammer/synth-plugin-book](https://github.com/TheAudioProgrammer/synth-plugin-book) for the most up-to-date version of the source code.

## How to use this repo

For each chapter there is a folder with the finished source code. Open the **JX11.jucer** file in **Projucer** and click the export button to open the project in your IDE.

The **Finished Project** folder contains the synth plug-in in its entirety, with added source code comments (it does not include the UI code from Chapter 13).

Want to know what the synth sounds like? Check out a few examples in the **Audio Demos** folder.
